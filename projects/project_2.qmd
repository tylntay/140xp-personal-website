## Description:

- Developed a rudimentary C++ prediction program using user inputted data to calculate kinematic values (distance, velocity, airtime, etc.) of a thrown football under ideal conditions

- Conducted an experiment to evaluate accuracy of program & compiled findings into a condensed lab report

- Researched & briefly summarized articles exploring physics behind a footballâ€™s flight path & use of modern technology in sports data analysis
